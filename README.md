# Data Retrieval

# Part 1: DDL Commands in SQL
Learn how to use DDL (Data Definition Language) Statements from the SQL Language to create and store Schemas in MySQL.  In this example, the data imported was based on the USD Exchange Rates for the month of January 2022. 

# Part 2: DML Commands in SQL
The purpose of this project was to be able to manipulate 5-Year Stock Data through an SQL database and DML statements.
Original Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/sandp500 Due to the size of the file (50000+ lines long), a select few companies were extracted from the main file and appended to a new, smaller database for manipulation.

# Part 3: TCL Commands in SQL
Progress in utilizing Transaction Control Language (TCL) Statements in Permanently Updating, Saving, and Undoing data changes.

Data:
Over 500 Logins of Coastal Carbon Data under the project name Celtic Explorer. R/V Celtic Explorer 2021, Visiting Ports in Cork, Galway, Ireland; Hamburg, Bremerhaven Germany from 2021-02-18 to 2021-08-29 10/year

Coastal regions are very important for understanding the carbon cycle. At these margins many processes are involved: runoff, upwelling and mixing of deep waters, photosynthesis, sinking organic particles, respiration, production and consumption of dissolved organic carbon. This complexity and the highly localized spatial variability of coastal regions has contibuted to a lack of data on carbon stored in coastal regions. CDIAC provides data management support for the Global Coastal Carbon Data Project which includes bottle (discrete) and surface (underway) carbon-related measurements from coastal research cruises, time series cruises, and coastal moorings. CDIAC's holdings include data for the Western North Atlantic including adjacent seas and Eastern North Atlantic including adjacent seas and Eastern North Pacific.
